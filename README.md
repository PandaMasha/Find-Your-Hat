# Find-Your-Hat
Codecademy Front-End Engineer course. 
In this project, weâ€™ll be building an interactive terminal game iwith JavaScript classes. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.
